### Title

What are the most common OSS security pitfall?

### Short description

We are all aware of OWASP top 10 and the most common vulnerabilities in API usage and web applications. However, have you considered what are the most common pitfalls of security risk in using open-source projects? In this talk, we will explore them and think of how we can avoid them.

### Long description

Background:

In 2023, 20 CISOs and technology veterans collaborated with Endor Labs’ Station 9 research team to analyse the most common security risk of using open-source projects 1. Open-source projects are now popularised not just by their availability but also quality of the software. However, not all open-source projects are well maintained and using open-source projects may consist of certain risks, this is even more important if we look at it from a security standpoint. It is important to understand those risks and carry out good practices while using open-source software and libraries.

Goal:

To provide information and considerations of best practices for companies and organisations which rely on open-source technologies. By exploring the potential risks and encouraging best practices within the engineering team, we can ensure the effective and safe use of open source within their companies and organisations.

Target audiences:

For those working in organizations that rely on open-source technologies and anyone who is using upstream open-source technologies in their projects.

Outline (40 mins):

- Popularity of open-source and the importance of open-source security (5 mins)
- Introduction of the research carried out by Endor Labs’ Station 9 research team (5 mins)
- Go over the 10 most common risks and how to avoid them (20 mins)
- Concluding list of best practices that any projects that used open-source projects should follow (5 mins)
- Discussion and Q&A (5 mins)
