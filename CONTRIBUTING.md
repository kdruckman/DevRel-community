# Contributing to OpenSSF DevRel Community

Thank you for contributing your time and expertise to the OpenSSF DevRel Community. This document describes the contribution guidelines for the project.

**Note:** Before you start contributing, you must read and abide by 
**[OpenSSF’s Code of Conduct](https://openssf.org/community/code-of-conduct)**.

## Orientation
### What is it we do around here, anyway?
The OpenSSF DevRel Community is affiliated with and managed by the Marketing Committee for the purpose of evangelizing the mission and work of the OpenSSF and building strong community outreach around end-users and open-source maintainers and contributors. 

For more about our purpose, Charter, and Goals, please see [README.md](./README.md).
### Who’s who in the zoo?
* [Cheuk Ting Ho](https://github.com/Cheukting) — OpenSSF Community Manager

Marketing Committee chairs serve as DevRel Community chairs
* [Katherine Druckman](https://github.com/kdruckman) — co-chair
* [Tracy Ragan](https://github.com/tracyragan) — co-chair

All of the other folks you see hanging around are there in a volunteer capacity.

If you would like to join them, this group is open to anyone with a passion for helping open source maintainers create more secure software to participate in!
### Where to find us?
We’re in the [**#devrel-community**](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C060PHUUPAA) channel of [OpenSSF Slack](https://openssf.slack.com/).

### What help is generally needed?
We’d love folks with this kind of experience:

* Folks with prior DevRel experience who can help with strategy / connections / general helping out
* Folks with experience running conferences, esp. events oriented around open source / security with a CFP process
* Folks who have public speaking experience, or want to learn!
* Folks with Product Marketing experience, specifically around explaining rather complex software projects so “mere mortals” can understand
* Folks with Project Management experience who can help with wrangling and prioritizing the work to do
* Folks with Community Management experience who can help with herding cats
* Open Source Maintainers, to provide “maintainer experience” feedback on OpenSSF tools and presentations

If you don't see your exact experience listed here, please join anyway! :D

## Ways to Contribute
### Meet us at… meetings!
You can talk with other folks interested in this initiative in “real time” during:

* **Monthly Monthly DevRel Community meetings** which happen the second Thursday of the month at 16:30 UTC ([your timezone](https://time.is/1630_in_UTC)) for updates of general goings on and general discussion. Feel free to add a topic to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qhqQKezqt4R9tfy3gh6MwatG-Tbs7MDPb2_LVzaeMOY/edit) and you can find notes from previous meetings in the [meetings](./meetings) folder.
* **Weekly Office Hours** which are weekly at 17:30 UTC ([your timezone](https://time.is/1730_in_UTC)) These are generally working sessions, but we hope to expand to activities like reviewing CFP submissions, offer space for folks to practice talks, etc.

If you're new to OpenSSF, see the [OpenSSF Community](https://github.com/ossf/community) repo for an explanation of what we do, how we are structured, and how to get involved.

### Pick up an issue to work on
Various initiatives are tracked as issues. We run as a “do-ocracy” so feel free to propose your own ideas or pick something up. Good places to start are issues marked [good first issue](https://github.com/ossf/DevRel-community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/ossf/DevRel-community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Feel free to chat about an issue you’re working on in Slack, or add it to the agenda of one of our next meetings for discussion!

### Host or speak at an OpenSSF Meetup
The [OpenSSF Meetup network](https://www.meetup.com/pro/openssf/) can always use help from folks with experience hosting or speaking at meetups.

See the [Meetup Organizing Guidelines](https://openssf.org/community/meetup-guidelines/).

### Contribute an OpenSSF Talk / Abstract
If you have an OpenSSF-related talk you’ve given in the past, and/or on one of OpenSSF’s related initiatives, you can submit a PR to add it to our [talk templates](./talk_templates).

### *Give* an OpenSSF Talk
If you’re interested in giving a talk about OpenSSF at a conference targeting open source developers and/or maintainers, you can find a list of [sample abstracts](./abstracts) as well as [talk templates](./talk_templates).

If you’d like feedback on your abstract or your talk, please join us during weekly office hours, which you can find on the [OpenSSF Community Calendar](https://openssf.org/getinvolved/)!
### Provide “Maintainer Experience” Feedback
If you’re an Open Source Project Maintainer, OpenSSF provides a number of [useful resources](https://best.openssf.org/developers) that are intended to help you secure your projects. We would greatly welcome feedback on these tools! Join our [#maintainer-experience](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C06JKSUFH32) channel on [OpenSSF Slack](https://openssf.slack.com/) — we would love to hear from you!

## FAQs
### How do decisions get made?
This is documented in our [Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hO6NuSiNr_7PO1QTYsB6qzcS8pAFW7p_6JT2y0XL5Nk/edit#heading=h.z9vrmtiy2usx), but generally speaking if a formal decision needs to be made, it’s handled during one of our monthly meetings, via a majority vote of attendees.

In the event that an escalation is needed, it first goes to the Marketing Committee and then ultimately to the Technical Advisory Council (TAC).
