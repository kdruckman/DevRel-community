## Farewell, Cheuk!
With @Cheukting's departure, there were questions about who was now running the monthly DevRel Community meeting. OpenSSF is hiring a backfill, but it's a Technical Program Manager vs. a Community Manager role.

It sounds like in the interim, the meetings fall to the co-chairs of the Marketing Advisory Council. Speaking of which...

## Changes to Marketing Committee structure
The Marketing Committee is now the [Marketing Advisory Council](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/03/14/openssf-marketing-advisory-council-aims-to-shape-the-future-of-open-source-security-advocacy/) (MAC), and is a benefit limited to OpenSSF Members.

The DevRel Community remains a sub-initiative of the MAC, and open to the general public for participation.

## Check-in on 1-pagers initiative
We checked in on https://github.com/ossf/DevRel-community/issues/35 ... 3 of the 6 identified projects now have content available! @katherined is going to take a stab at formatting them into a template, so they can be showed off at Open Source Summit in two weeks!

## Using YouTube for meetings to help raise awareness of OpenSSF
@nikitaselev raised a valid point that to make the activities of the OpenSSF more open/transparent we could "go where developers are" and hold this meeting on YouTube instead. Issue creatd to discuss this idea here: https://github.com/ossf/DevRel-community/issues/38

# Actions
* @katherined to create a sample 1-pager for review
