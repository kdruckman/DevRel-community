## Discussion note

- The “one size fits all” approach may not be the perfect solution for oss projects
- Right now OpenSSF is targeted at coorperate so far and now we should talk about our target
- Telling people about what is the work of OpenSSF
- What is the need of the open-source community
- Our roles is support people who want to contribute for example speaking at events that they are able to travel to
- May be in the future there can be more support
- Formulate a knowledge based for people to find talk materials and topics
- Cheuk will provide extra speaking support if needed
- Will there be help regarding understanding regulations e.g. CRA
- Persona documentation that is WIP: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zhryCcHS-jVdTyhVRctcsgxDPXSCui5szS58fdbJh9g/edit?usp=sharing (need to combin all personas in various WG into a uniset of personas)
- Explained what OpenSSF does because it is confusing at times as there are many toolings
- What are people interested in? Education maybe?
- Doesn’t need to be expert to advocating for OpenSSF
- How can people bring more security practice in software development?
- Communicate the importance of security
- How to bring more community into OpenSSF, how can we lead people in
- Target developers to have a say to the oss projects that they are using - users and maintainers should both be targets
- Goal: increase adoption of the toolings or secure open source projects
- Not just toolings, there are much more beyond
- Mission: Make OpenSSF the reference point of the community to look at regarding security
- Activities: can be editorial focus, provide more dev rel type blog contents
- Activities: review guest blog submissions, provide contents that is educational and useful
- Unifying education materials that devs found it useful
- Bring people who are not normally there into open-soruce security
